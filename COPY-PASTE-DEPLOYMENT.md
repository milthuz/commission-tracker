## üíª STEP 2: DEPLOY BACKEND (HEROKU)

### 2a. Install Heroku CLI

**macOS:**
```bash
brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku
```

**Linux:**
```bash
curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**
Download from: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

### 2b. Login to Heroku
```bash
heroku login
```
This opens your browser to login. Do that, then come back.

### 2c. Create Heroku App
```bash
heroku create commission-tracker-api
```

**Important**: Copy the URL you get back, it looks like:
```
https://commission-tracker-api.herokuapp.com
```

**Save your backend URL here:** 
```
https://commission-tracker-api.herokuapp.com
```

### 2d. Set Environment Variables

Copy this and replace the XXX values with YOUR credentials:

```bash
heroku config:set \
  ZOHO_CLIENT_ID="XXX_YOUR_CLIENT_ID" \
  ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET="XXX_YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  ZOHO_ORG_ID="XXX_YOUR_ORG_ID" \
  ZOHO_ACCOUNTS_URL="https://accounts.zoho.com" \
  ZOHO_API_URL="https://www.zohoapis.com" \
  JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  NODE_ENV="production"
```

### 2e. Create Procfile

In your project directory, create a file named `Procfile` (no extension):

```
web: node server.js
```

### 2f. Deploy to Heroku

```bash
git add Procfile
git commit -m "Add Procfile for Heroku"
git push heroku main
```

(Or `git push heroku master` if your branch is master)

### 2g. Check It's Running

```bash
heroku logs --tail
```

You should see the app starting up. If it says "listening on port 3000" or similar, it's working!

Test with:
```bash
curl https://commission-tracker-api.herokuapp.com/api/health
```

---

## ‚öõÔ∏è STEP 3: DEPLOY FRONTEND (VERCEL)

### 3a. Push Code to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```
(Or `git push origin master`)

### 3b. Deploy on Vercel

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/
2. Click "Add New..." ‚Üí "Project"
3. Click "Import Git Repository"
4. Paste your GitHub repository URL
5. Click "Continue"
6. It will show your project
7. Scroll down to "Environment Variables"

### 3c. Add Environment Variables

Add these TWO variables:

**Variable 1:**
```
Name:  REACT_APP_API_URL
Value: https://commission-tracker-api.herokuapp.com
```
(Or your custom backend URL)

**Variable 2:**
```
Name:  REACT_APP_ZOHO_ORG_ID
Value: [YOUR_ORG_ID]
```

### 3d. Click Deploy

Vercel will build and deploy your app. This takes about 1-2 minutes.

When done, you'll get a URL like:
```
https://commission-tracker-xxxxxxxx.vercel.app
```

**Save your frontend URL here:**
```
https://commission-tracker-xxxxxxxx.vercel.app
```

## üîó STEP 4: CONNECT EVERYTHING

### 4a. Tell Backend About Frontend

```

(Replace with YOUR Vercel URL)

### 4b. Update Zoho OAuth Settings

1. Go to: https://api-console.zoho.com
2. Find your app and click Edit
3. Go to "Redirect URIs"
4. Add these TWO URIs:
   ```
   https://commission-tracker-api.herokuapp.com/api/auth/callback
   https://commission-tracker-xxxxxxxx.vercel.app/api/auth/callback
   ```
5. Click Save

---

## üß™ STEP 5: TEST EVERYTHING

### 5a. Test Backend
```bash
curl https://commission-tracker-api.herokuapp.com/api/health

```

### 5b. Test Frontend

1. Open your Vercel URL in browser
2. You should see a login page

### 5c. Try Demo Login

3. Should see dashboard with mock commissions

### 5d. Try Zoho OAuth

1. On the dashboard, look for "Connect with Zoho" button
2. Click it
3. Login with your Zoho account
4. Should redirect back to app

### 5e. Create Test Invoice

1. Go to Zoho Books: https://www.zoho.com/books/
2. Create new invoice:
   - Customer: Test
   - Amount: $1000
   - Line item: Product - $1000
   - Mark as PAID
   - Sales Rep: Your Name

3. Back in your app, refresh the page
4. You should see $100 commission (10% of $1000)

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Redirect URI mismatch" error
- Go to https://api-console.zoho.com
- Make sure the redirect URIs EXACTLY match your deployment URLs
- No extra spaces, trailing slashes, or typos

### "Can't connect to API" error
- Check backend URL is correct in REACT_APP_API_URL
- Make sure backend is running: `heroku logs --tail -a commission-tracker-api`
- Wait a few seconds and try again

### "No commissions showing" 
- Make sure invoice is PAID status in Zoho
- Make sure salesperson is assigned

- Upgrade to Paid Dynos ($7/month) when ready
- Or switch to DigitalOcean ($5/month)
